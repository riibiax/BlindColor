Blind Colors is an iOS application able to create an abstract painting using sounds and colors.

What’s the meaning of colors for the blinds? My purpose was to make an interface to connect two different worlds: people used to see colors and people who doesn’t know colors.

Each color around us could generate a sound, using its properties: brightness, hue, saturation. They could be converted to a sound note.

Clicking on the screen we listen to «color-sounds» and in the same time we add strokes on the screen’s canvas.

Following the generated music, fingers become the paint brushes of objects, places, persons, etc. around the user.
